# KMP Notes App
A simple toy app written in Kotlin, Swift and it have shared ui using Compose multiplatform
I created this app for fun and explore KMP since now it has it first stable release, but most importantly
I want to create a different simplified version of [Fresh Notes App](https://github.com/freshtechtips/fresh-notes-app)
which is written in Flutter, I used Java first then moved to Kotlin and I have using it for many years and I really like it
Of course I prefer to use Kotlin for the cross platform apps that have shared Ui and Logic and I wanted to give it a try and it
was amazing and more than I expected, the only things that is missing in my opinion are hot-reload and hot-restart which will
I'm used to it in `Flutter`, `NodeJs`, `Ktor server` and some other frameworks like `React` and `NextJs` etc...

By the time of creating this simple app the Fresh notes app haven't finished yet since there are other tasks but it will be soon.
